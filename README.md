# Wi-Crypt

Wi-Crypt is a Python-based encryption/decryption software that provides two options for securing your data: Symmetric (Key-Based Encryption) and Scrypt (Password-Based Encryption). The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt files with ease.

## Features

- **Symmetric Encryption (Key-Based):** Utilize a key for encryption and decryption.
- **Scrypt Encryption (Password-Based):** Secure your data with a password-based encryption approach.
- **Easy-to-Use:** Simply run the Python file and follow the on-screen instructions in the terminal to encrypt or decrypt your data.
